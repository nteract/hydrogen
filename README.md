This package lets you run your code directly in Atom using any [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) kernels you have installed.

Checkout our [Documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/) and [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/nteract/hydrogen-interactive-computing-in-atom-89d291bcc4dd) to see what you can do with Hydrogen.

## Background

Hydrogen was inspired by Bret Victor's ideas about the power of instantaneous feedback and the design of [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/). Running code inline and in real time is a more natural way to develop. By bringing the interactive style of Light Table to the rock-solid usability of Atom, Hydrogen makes it easy to write code the way you want to.

## Features

- execute a line, selection, or block at a time
- rich media support for plots, images, and video
- watch expressions let you keep track of variables and re-run snippets after every change
- completions from the running kernel, just like autocomplete in the Chrome dev tools
- code can be inspected to show useful information provided by the running kernel
- one kernel per language (so you can run snippets from several files, all in the same namespace)
- interrupt or restart the kernel if anything goes wrong
- use a custom kernel connection (for example to run code inside Docker), read more in the "Custom kernel connection (inside Docker)" section

## Plugins for Hydrogen

Hydrogen has support for plugins. Feel free to add your own to the list:
- [Hydrogen Launcher](https://github.com/lgeiger/hydrogen-launcher)

If you are interested in building a plugin take a look at our [plugin API documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/PluginAPI.md).

## How it works

Hydrogen implements the [messaging protocol](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html) for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter (formerly IPython) uses ZeroMQ to connect a client (like Hydrogen) to a running kernel (like IJulia or iTorch). The client sends code to be executed to the kernel, which runs it and sends back results.

## Why "Hydrogen"?

Hydrogen atoms make up 90% of Jupiter by volume.

Plus, it was easy to make a logo.
