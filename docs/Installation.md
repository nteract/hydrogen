# Installation

For all systems, you'll need

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) `1.6.0+`
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org): If you have Python and conda or pip setup, install the notebook directly with `conda install jupyter` or `pip install jupyter`.

You can now run `apm install hydrogen` or search for *Hydrogen* in the Install pane of the Atom settings.

If you are using Linux 32-bit follow the installation instructions [here](Troubleshooting.md).

## Kernels

Tested and works with:

- [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
- [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)
- [iTorch](https://github.com/facebook/iTorch)
- [IJavascript](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript)
- [jupyter-nodejs](https://github.com/notablemind/jupyter-nodejs)
- [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) `0.4+`
- [IElixir](https://github.com/pprzetacznik/IElixir)
- [jupyter-scala](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala)

But it _should_ work with any [kernel](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). If you are using Hydrogen with another kernel please add it to this list orÂ [post an issue](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues) if anything is broken!

Note that if you install a new kernel, you'll need to run **Hydrogen: Update Kernels** for Hydrogen to find it. For performance reasons, Hydrogen only looks for available kernels when it first starts.

### Debian 8 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Unfortunately, the versions of IPython provided in Debian's and Ubuntu's
repositories are rather old and Hydrogen is unable to detect the kernel specs
installed in your machine. To workaround this issue, Hydrogen provides the
setting `KernelSpec`, where the user can declare the kernel specs manually.
Find the `KernelSpec` setting in the Atom GUI by going to the Settings pane,
click Packages, search for Hydrogen, and click the Hydrogen Settings button.

Below is an example `KernelSpec` for IPython 2 and 3:

```json
{
  "kernelspecs": {
    "python2": {
      "spec": {
        "display_name": "Python 2",
        "language": "python",
        "argv": ["python2.7", "-m", "ipykernel", "-f", "{connection_file}"],
        "env": {}
      }
    },
    "python3": {
      "spec": {
        "display_name": "Python 3",
        "language": "python",
        "argv": ["python3.4", "-m", "ipykernel", "-f", "{connection_file}"],
        "env": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
