# Troubleshooting

## Debugging Guide

Sometimes unexpected things happen.
In this case, please, open an [Issue](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues) and make sure to include the version of Hydrogen and Atom you are running. You can get this information by running `atom --version` from the command line.

Please, also include the output or a screenshot of the debug messages. To access the debug messages follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings tab by pressing (`ctrl-,`), select the Hydrogen package (`Packages --> Hydrogen`), and tick `Enable Debug Messages`:

2. Open the developer tools (`View --> Developer --> Toggle Developer Tools` or via `shift-ctrl-i`/`cmd-alt-i`):

3. Select the Console tab to see the debug logs and run the code causing the issue:

## Common Issues

### Installation fails on Linux 32-bit

At the moment we don't ship prebuilts for 32-bit Linux. Hence you'll need some additional toolling to build from source:

- `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is not supported for building Hydrogen)
- `make`
- A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Use your distribution's package manager to install.

If your default `python` is 3.x, you need to run instead `PYTHON=python2.7 apm install hydrogen` or change the default version for `apm` with `apm config set python $(which python2.7)` beforehand. You can still use 3.x versions of Python in Hydrogen, but it will only build with 2.x due to a [longstanding issue with `gyp`](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gyp/issues/detail?id=36).

### No kernel for language X found

Hydrogen requires a Kernel to run code. Checkout [nteract.io/kernels](https://nteract.io/kernels) for instructions on how to install the most popular kernels.

Atom won't pick up kernels inside a virtualenv unless Atom is launched as `atom .` within the virtualenv. The alternative is to [create a kernel specifically for a virtualenv](http://www.alfredo.motta.name/create-isolated-jupyter-ipython-kernels-with-pyenv-and-virtualenv/).


### Hydrogen doesn't show my results.

Again, there are a number of possible causes and solutions:

- If the result bubble only shows check marks (see issues
  [#61](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/61),
  [#68](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/68),
  [#73](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/73),
  [#88](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/88)):

  - solved by upgrading the `jupyter` version (see [this
    comment](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/88#issuecomment-136761769) );

- If Hydrogen doesn't output any results for Atom version < 1.13 (see issue
  [#326](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/326)), check that you haven't disabled
  `Use Shadow DOM` under `Settings > Editor`. This option should be enabled.

- If the spinner in the result bubble never stops (see issue
  [#53](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/53)): This is issue hasn't
  been seen recently. Please, post in issue
  [#53](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/53) the details of your
  installation.





## Setting environment variables on Windows


### Hydrogen fails to import modules:
If hydrogen works for standard libraries but you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_package'` for custom installed packages, check that the path of the kernel you are using is the one specified in the windows `PATH`. Especially when using virtual environments like `virtualenv` and `anaconda` ensure that the corresponding python executables are set in the windows path. 

To add the path, enter `where python` in the windows command line and chose the apporiate entry. Then, add it manually to the windows `PATH`, similarly as detailed below for the standard python path.


### Hydrogen does not recognize python:

On Windows if Python is not added to your environment variables, Hydrogen won't be able to locate your Python installations (`No kernel specs found`).

![Kernel specs not found](https://preview.ibb.co/jw40ta/Screenshot_40.png)

To solve this problem you need to add Python to your systems environment variables. This can be done in 2 ways:

- During Python installation
- Manually adding in the Environment variables

#### During Python installation:

While installing Python check *Add Python to environment variables*. It will do the rest of work for you!

If you already have Python installed then you may not need to uninstall it just follow the steps:

- Go to the *Uninstall or Change a Program* Menu
- Select your Python version
- Click on the *Uninstall/Change* button
- Select *Modify* from the appeared menu
- Click on *Next*
- Check mark *Add python to environment variables*
- And finish the installation process

#### Manually adding Python to Environment variables:

You can also add Python to the environment variables manually

  - In *Control Panel* search for *environment variables*
  - Click on *Edit system environment variables*
  - Click on *Environment variables*
  - From the *System variables* tab select *Path* and click on *Edit*
  - Click on *New* and add `C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\`
  - Click on *New* again and add `C:\Program Files\Python36\`
  - Click on *OK* to finish, now your problem is fixed!
