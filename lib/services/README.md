## Services API

The [Atom Services API](https://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services/) is a way for Atom packages to interact with each other. Hydrogen both provides and consumes *services* to add additional features to itself. `./lib/services` is our container folder for anything that functions through the [Atom Services API](https://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services/). If the service is considered a *provided service*, then it is located inside of `./lib/services/provided`. If the service, however, is considered a *consumed service*, then it is located inside of `./lib/services/consumed`.

### Consumed Services
- [Status Bar Tile: `status-bar`](./consumed/status-bar/status-bar.js)
   - This allows us to add kernel controls to the status bar.
- [Autocomplete For Any Editor: `autocomplete-plus`](./consumed/autocomplete.js)
   - This allows us to add autocomplete to things like watches.

### Provided Services
- [Autocomplete Results: `autocomplete-plus`](./provided/autocomplete.js)
   - This allows us to provide autocomplete results that are similar to jupyter's tab completion.
